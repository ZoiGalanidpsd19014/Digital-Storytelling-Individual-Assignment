# Introduction
 Hello this is my report about the animation assignment for my Uni. This is the first time I am using Unity and to be honest, i am pretty excited since I want to get into animation and game developement/ graphic designer in the near future. So this class is very exciting for me! :)


# Summary

So as I said before, this is an animation project using the Unity programm. The theme I was going for is a city resembling NYC. If you'll look at the mp4 videos of each deliverable you will see that some props that were not supposed to be there for the 1st deliverable are shown, that's because I went ahead and started putting props and details that are not required for the requirements for the 1st deliverable. Makes sense? Basically I stayed and built a lot of stuff before i made the 1st mp4.![buildings_screenshot2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100948882/224729836-746a3a69-9dec-4bcb-b7db-8fa6a9fee748.png)

# 1st Deliverable

<h2><strong>UNIT_2</strong></h2>

<br>Regarding the first deliverable, i started it right away in the class, I mean using the Unit1_StarterFiles. I made some buildings here and there using the ProBuilder tool as described in the UNIT2 tutorials we were using in our class. At home, i made more buildings and used the ProBuilder to make their shapes more complex, with different sizes, edges, faces.
<br>![buildning_fallijg](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100948882/224665876-bb1b0fb9-ca80-4fb7-b79f-829db395182c.png)
<br>![bulding_crooked_top](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100948882/224665911-e3739367-5c78-4c8f-9566-91dba7323eaa.png)
<br>![empire_state2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100948882/224665964-1d0a988b-0bfc-4f6e-89e6-b5c923ae10ba.png)
<br>![tower2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100948882/224666041-b87895e8-9527-4d70-9977-65cf85de6118.png)
<br>![tower](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100948882/224666067-1b7f4079-66d1-4500-afe8-cb53f82e4ece.png)

<br>At the same time, i downloaded some images (jpg) from the interet for the texture/material i was going to put on the buildings to make them look more like "buildings" for ex. having windows. I made the materials with the images in unity and put them in the asset/materials folder. 
<br>![materials_screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100948882/224666207-5d137bd2-770e-4553-8c09-f5951a44f9d7.png)

<br>Then i started applying the materials to the buildings. Since i had made a lot of buildings with different sizes, I had to duplicate the same materials on or two times in order to change the tiling that seemed more aproppriate for the specific building- in order to make you understand a material with x tiling to a tall building looked streched/compressed/ dissorted to another shorter building. So i had to make a mataerial for the tall, and another woth different tiling for the other and so on. Also i played a little with the offset of the material in order to match where the texture is more realistic to be. In some buildings I also made a base with a plain color material to indicate 'this is the ground floor' but i honestly didn't do it for all the buildings. As i was making the buildings i tried to make stairs and doors for them but unfortunately they were too big for the ratio i was trying to achieve, so i didn't put any doors (imagine that a door from the probuilder at the smallest size looked huge for the bulding/material, but i managed to put stairs!
<br>![textures_screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100948882/224665241-72459271-388f-4a42-b85e-aac6fcd61d18.png)
<br>![stairs](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100948882/224732839-d3433cb3-40bd-4fa9-9ee4-ce23acf2fd41.png)

<br>So i duplicated a lot of the buildings I've madeand started putting them in blocks like multi-highrises. (there is a big mixup with the nams in hierarchy bc i did blocks of buildings and not multihighrises so i will solve this later).
I rotated the building, changed the scale however i wanted to but tried to make them all have the same distance from the road -I'll explain it in the 2nd deliverable- in order to make the idea that there is a pavement between the buildings and the roads.

<h2><strong>UNIT_3</strong></h2>

 <br>For the 2nd part, i started making the props i was going to use. The first prop i created was the watertank. In NYC you will notice that some buildings have watertanks on the roof, so i went and made that. I used basic shapes like cylinders and cubes and wtih a little roating, scaling and placements i made the base that consists of the legs (cubes), the main body (cylinder with a notch upwards like a cone) and the ladder (cylinders).
 
 <br>![watertank_top_screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100948882/224666309-97cceff1-9e98-4970-aaa3-ff691bc8fb8c.png)
 <br>![watertank_screenchot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100948882/224666340-d05a185f-f2a6-44a0-ae05-5934495f9f4f.png)
<br>![watertank_with_materials](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100948882/224666355-c3b4ea87-e6a5-4048-a79c-6b338bb0956d.png)

<br>Another area that i used 2 props was the park 
<br>![park_screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100948882/224724732-9f4c131b-d9be-4f14-9ec2-fa92782a4dc3.png)

<br>For starters I made a plane with a grass texture/material to resemble grass.
<br>![plane_grass_park](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100948882/224725140-db73deb4-72b7-4cb5-9544-c879d1991b0a.png) 
<br>Then i made a path with a plane that connects the 2 ends of the park, putting a color material onto it.
<br>![path_screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100948882/224725348-5b24636a-997d-461e-b77d-fd498eae0ce7.png)


<br>Then i made a wall with a scaled cube and I put a brick texture/material on it. Then i duplicated it and put it on the other side of the park, so now I have 2 brick walls.
<br>![wall_screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100948882/224725517-51827654-7d14-4067-8e6c-bf6bce21705c.png)

<br>After that I made the fences, basically I made a fence by alligning and duplicating a lot of rotated and scaled cylinders, and with the help of the duplicate tool I put 4 fences, with an open entrance/exit.
<br>![fence_screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100948882/224725889-8386b0a9-494f-4598-81c9-a524f6ab098f.png)

<br>In the park, I made a lake by adding a capsule shape, rotated it and cut the faces of the upper half. Then I filled the hole by the edges so I was left with a half-capsule. I painted it blue with a material and placed it just below the grass plane.
<br>![lake_screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100948882/224726339-4fd85059-24b9-4723-9b03-cf0c59934f62.png)

<br>Now, I imported from the Unity Asset store some free models of benches, trees and grass(credits at the end of the page). I duplicated them and put them in the park.
 
<br>![trees_screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100948882/224726710-8c4616cc-4683-4101-a46d-ebcf481e7313.png)
<br>![bench1_screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100948882/224726815-5ba5060f-e2cd-4725-a310-5dee39eb425a.png)
<br>![2benches_screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100948882/224726833-77a83ebe-748a-4cd6-a51a-60316ff03ba0.png)
<br>![grass](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100948882/224733401-9e0292e4-9d85-494d-a740-24c623a1bde6.png)

<br>Leaving the park behind, I made the roads. I made a prefab of a road using only planes, scaling them and assigning them color.
 <br>![roadprefab](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100948882/224730218-bdb7da63-936d-4253-ae58-3a0e4467c49c.png)
 <br>![roads_screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100948882/224730401-1fdc357e-247f-4727-bbf0-2acd75026036.png)

<br>I organised the road to 2 sections: the AVES that are parallel and are only 2, at the edges of the city
<br> ![aves_screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100948882/224730582-424b61ba-411c-4cdd-b564-db8a8e4e4433.png)
<br>and the streets, that are too parallel between them with one vertical
<br>![streets_screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100948882/224730761-a0134350-e305-4ab6-bb16-4def08b9d94a.png)

<br>I made some pedestrian crossings using planes and assigned them to their parents ave or street they belong to
![road_close_up](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100948882/224731035-df9ce775-702b-4b87-921c-4f04622eba9b.png)

<br>In one ave I made 2 bus lanes using again duplicated planes with a red color material.
![road_with_bus](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100948882/224731293-d24f4eb1-3bcd-4c23-881a-3eaab01a675f.png)

<br>And now for the last propr I imported from the Asset Store are the cars and buses. I probably used 2 models of cars and I made some variations of them by assigning them a specific color; ex white car, blue car, yellow car (taxi), black car and so on. The bus model I painted it with a blue color material.
